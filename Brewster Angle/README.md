# Determination of Refractive Index by Brewster Angle Method

**Brewster's angle** (also known as the polarization angle) is the angle of incidence at which light with a particular polarization is **perfectly transmitted** through a transparent dielectric surface, with no reflection. When unpolarized light is incident at this angle, the light that is reflected from the surface is perfectly polarized. — _Wikipedia_

## Overview

Experimental setup as given in the LM. We simply take multiple observations of $\theta_{B}$ and calculate refractive index $n$, along with error.

## Notes

The calculations required in this experiment can be completely done on a software like Excel. I am simply including this here for the sake of completeness.

Error is propagated as shown below:

$$
\delta n = sec^{2}(\bar{\theta})\times \delta \theta
$$
